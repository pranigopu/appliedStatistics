# Hypothesis testing

# 1. Introduction
For a given situation (which could be a sample data set, a type of random process, etc.), we define an estimator to serve a required purpose, ex. estimate a parameter of the population from which a given set of samples are drawn. This estimator or some function of it is the test statistic.

To test how plausible the observed value of the test statistic is, we need to have some idea about the probability distribution of the test statistic as such. The essence of hypothesis testing is figuring out (through exact derivations or approximations) the test statistic's probability distribution and using it to judge the plausibility of an observed value; We ask, in effect, "Given the data and the assumptions/knowledge about the distributions, is the observed value too extreme?"
